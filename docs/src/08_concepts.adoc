=== User Experience

The user interface is the part of our application with which users interact directly. 
It's designed to be intuitive and easy to use, providing a smooth and pleasant experience for users as they navigate through the various functions and features of the application.

The user will either register in the application or log in if they have already registered before. 
If they have played before, they will be able to view different metrics regarding those games. 
Additionally, they can start a new game at any time and, upon completion, view the statistics of their results.
